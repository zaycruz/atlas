### Core Principles Identified
1. **Multi-layered Architecture**: Working → Session → Long-term memory hierarchy
2. **Temporal Dynamics**: Recent memories weighted higher with decay functions
3. **Context Preservation**: Overlap and parent-child relationships prevent fragmentation
4. **Semantic Organization**: Clustering and graph-based associations
5. **Adaptive Retrieval**: Combined similarity + temporal + contextual scoring

## Phase 1: Core Architecture Improvements

### 1. Contextual Chunking (Priority: High)

**Problem**: Current system embeds entire conversation turns, losing granular context for long interactions.

**Solution**: Implement parent-child chunking with contextual overlap.

**Implementation**:
- Split conversations into 300-500 character semantic chunks
- Maintain 20% overlap between adjacent chunks
- Store both chunk embeddings and full conversation context
- Retrieve precise chunks but return parent context to LLM

**New Classes**:
```python
@dataclass
class ChunkedMemoryRecord:
    """Memory record with hierarchical chunking support."""
    id: str
    parent_id: Optional[str]  # Links to parent conversation
    chunk_index: int          # Position within parent
    content: str             # Chunk content
    full_context: str        # Parent conversation context
    timestamp: float
    embedding: Optional[List[float]]
    overlap_start: int       # Characters of overlap at start
    overlap_end: int         # Characters of overlap at end
```

### 2. Temporal Decay Weighting (Priority: High)

**Problem**: All memories have equal weight regardless of recency.

**Solution**: Exponential decay function with configurable parameters.

**Implementation**:
```python
def temporal_weight(timestamp: float, decay_rate: float = 0.1) -> float:
    """Calculate temporal decay weight for memory relevance.
    
    Args:
        timestamp: Memory creation timestamp
        decay_rate: Decay rate per hour (default: 0.1)
    
    Returns:
        Weight multiplier (0.0-1.0)
    """
    age_hours = (time.time() - timestamp) / 3600
    return math.exp(-decay_rate * age_hours)
```

### 3. Session Memory Layer (Priority: Medium)

**Problem**: Gap between working memory (12 turns) and long-term episodic storage.

**Solution**: Intermediate session-level memory for recent context.

**Implementation**:
```python
class SessionMemory:
    """Intermediate memory layer for recent conversation context."""
    
    def __init__(self, duration_hours: float = 2.0):
        self.duration_hours = duration_hours
        self.session_records: List[MemoryRecord] = []
    
    def add_turn(self, user: str, assistant: str) -> None:
        """Add conversation turn to session memory."""
        
    def get_session_context(self, max_turns: int = 20) -> List[MemoryRecord]:
        """Retrieve recent session context."""
        
    def promote_to_longterm(self, episodic_memory: EpisodicMemory) -> None:
        """Promote important session memories to long-term storage."""
```

## Phase 2: Quality & Observability Enhancements

### 4. Memory Metrics (Priority: Medium)

**Problem**: No visibility into memory performance and usage patterns.

**Solution**: Comprehensive metrics collection and analysis.

**Metrics to Track**:
- Retrieval accuracy and relevance scores
- Memory utilization by type and age
- Query-to-memory match quality
- Access frequency patterns
- Storage efficiency metrics

### 5. Memory Reinforcement (Priority: Medium)

**Problem**: All memories fade equally regardless of usefulness.

**Solution**: Frequency-based reinforcement and forgetting curves.

**Implementation**:
```python
@dataclass
class ReinforcedMemoryRecord(MemoryRecord):
    """Memory record with reinforcement tracking."""
    access_count: int = 0
    last_accessed: float = field(default_factory=time.time)
    importance_score: float = 1.0
    
    def access(self) -> None:
        """Record memory access for reinforcement."""
        self.access_count += 1
        self.last_accessed = time.time()
        # Boost importance based on frequency
        self.importance_score *= 1.1
```

### 6. Semantic Clustering (Priority: Low)

**Problem**: Related memories scattered across storage without thematic organization.

**Solution**: Hierarchical clustering of memory embeddings.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Test Requirements
1. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% coverage for all new memory components
2. **Edge Cases**: Empty memories, malformed embeddings, timestamp edge cases
3. **Performance**: Memory retrieval under 100ms for typical queries
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing memory files must load without modification

### Integration Test Requirements
1. **End-to-End**: Full conversation flow with enhanced memory
2. **Memory Migration**: Upgrade existing memory files seamlessly
3. **Agent Integration**: Verify agent.py works with new memory interfaces
4. **CLI Integration**: Ensure CLI commands work with enhanced memory

### Test Data Strategy
```python
# Test embeddings for consistent behavior
def test_keyword_embedder(text: str) -> List[float]:
    """Deterministic embedder for testing."""
    return [
        1.0 if "alpha" in text else 0.0,
        1.0 if "beta" in text else 0.0, 
        1.0 if "gamma" in text else 0.0,
        1.0 if "important" in text else 0.0,
        1.0 if "recent" in text else 0.0,
    ]
```

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing `MemoryRecord` format remains supported
- New `ChunkedMemoryRecord` extends base functionality
- Automatic migration on first load of enhanced memory system
- Fallback to legacy behavior if migration fails

### Data Migration Process
1. Load existing episodic memory file
2. Convert records to chunked format with single chunk per record
3. Add default values for new fields (access_count=0, importance_score=1.0)
4. Save migrated data with backup of original
5. Log migration statistics

## Code Style Guidelines

### Documentation Requirements
- All classes and methods must have comprehensive docstrings
- Include type hints for all parameters and return values
- Document complexity and performance characteristics
- Provide usage examples in docstrings

### Testing Requirements
