# Atlas Autonomy Policies
# Defines triggers and thresholds for autonomous behaviors

# Reflection triggers - when Atlas should automatically reflect/journal
reflection:
  turns_since_last: 20  # Reflect after N conversation turns
  new_goal_detected: true  # Reflect when new goals are added/changed
  contradiction_detected: true  # Reflect when semantic profile contradictions found
  end_of_day: true  # Reflect at end of day (daily summary)

# Disagreement triggers - when Atlas should challenge user plans
disagreement:
  risk_conflict: true  # Disagree if plan conflicts with user's stated risk tolerance
  repeated_failure: true  # Disagree if plan matches patterns of past failures in memory

# Autonomy levels (future use)
autonomy:
  max_daily_reflections: 5  # Limit reflections per day
  disagreement_cooldown: 10  # Minutes between disagreements
  tool_confirmation_threshold: "high"  # When to require confirmation for tools
