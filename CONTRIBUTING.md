# Contributing to Atlas

Thanks for your interest in improving Atlas! We manage dependencies and tooling with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). To keep the process simple:

1. **Fork and branch** from `main` (or `dev` if a feature freeze is announced).
2. **Install deps** via `poetry install`, then run tests with `poetry run pytest` before opening a pull request.
3. **Follow style conventions** already used in the codebase (PEPÂ 8, typed functions, concise docstrings).
4. **Document changes** in `docs/PROJECT_TRACKER.md` when they affect roadmap or task status.

Pull requests should include a short summary, test plan, and any relevant screenshots or logs. We welcome improvements to docs, tests, and tooling alongside core features.
